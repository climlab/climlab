RRTMG_LW Release Notes

NOTE: ** CVS rtags can't accept "." in strings, substitute "_"


April 8, 2011:

        Release_4_85

        A minor fix was made to rrtmg_lw_taumol.f90 to the code introduced in 
        v4.82 to correct 'specparm' to read 'specparm1' at line 1513 in band 7.
        This change has no impact in moderate to high moisture profiles such as 
        mid-latitude summer and tropical. The largest impact will occur in cold, 
        dry profiles such as mid-latitude winter, or sub-arctic winter. In these 
        profiles, the impact is generally less than 0.05 Wm-2 in flux and less 
        than 0.06 Kd-1 in heating rate. Other minor changes were made to improve 
        code compatibility with g95 compilers that have no effect on output. 

        Internal release only. 


November 16, 2009:

        Release_4_84

        An optional feature was added to the model to provide the vertical 
        profile of the change in upward flux with respect to surface temperature.
        This option is controlled by a new flag, idrv.  Setting this flag to one
        will output dF/dT for total sky and clear sky in GCM mode in new output
        arrays duflx_dt and duflxc_dt.  These can be utilized to approximate the
        change in upward flux for a change in surface temperature only at time
        intervals between full radiation calls.  In single column mode, setting
        idrv to 1 requires the extra input of a dT change in surface temperature
        relative to the input surface temperature, and the provided dT will be
        applied to the flux derivative to output a modified upward flux profile
        for that dT change in surface temperature.  Setting idrv to 0 provides 
        the original forward radiative transfer calculation.  

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in November 2009.


October 20, 2009:

        Release_4_82

        Installed code fix to module rrtmg_lw_taumol.f90 to revise definition
        and use of the key species ratio parameter (eta) in some spectral bands.
        Results are changed in profiles with low water vapor and low temperature.
        Downward surface fluxes are typically increased by this change by about 
        0.1 W m-2, with downward flux in some layers increased by as much as
        0.5 W m-2 in some profiles.  Upward flux changes are smaller.  Heating 
        rate changes are generally negligible.  There are no changes in flux or 
        heating rate in profiles with moderate to high water vapor such as 
        mid-latitude summer or tropical. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in October 2009.


May 22, 2009:

        Release_4_8

        Added fix for internal cloud property option (iceflag=1) to correct the
        integer index that accesses the input coefficient arrays that are used to  
        calculate the ice cloud absorption for this option.  Other cloud optical 
        property options are unaffected.  Also reduced several input data array
        dimensions containing the Planck fractions to remove unused array 
        elements.  Several minor code changes were made to allow the model to
        compile and run under single precision.  New option added to input
        absorption coefficient data either through original source statements
        or through a netCDF data file. Choice of input source is selected in
        the makefile. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in May 2009.

        - Added option for obtaining input absorption coefficient data either
          through a netCDF file or through the original source statements. 
          Global attributes of netCDF file header include detail on RRTM_LW
          source version of k-distribution data and water continuum version. 
        - Fixed integer index that accesses the cloud absorption data arrays for 
          the iceflag=1 cloud property option in rrtmg_lw_cldprmc.f90. 
        - Changed declarations of fracfefao and fracrefa in module rrlw_kg03.f90 
          and of fracrefbo and fracrefb in module rrlw_kg04.f90 to remove unused
          array elements.
        - Made several minor code changes, which do not affect results, to allow 
          better compilation and running of model with single precision.  
        - Modified use associations related to rrlw_kgnn.f90 modules in source 
          files rrtmg_lw_taumol.f90 and rrtmg_lw_init.f90 for compatibility with
          gfortran and ifort compilers.  This has no affect on results. 
        - Added makefile in build directory for IBM XL platforms. 
        - Changed lower bound of allowable liquid droplet effective radius from 
          1.5 to 2.5 microns for the inflag=2/liqflag=1 cloud input option. 
        - Added a few updates to the file rrtmg_lw_instructions.txt. 


September 17, 2008:

        Release_4_71

        Modified input of ice particle effective size to require input of value
        appropriate for the selected ice optics parameterization. Previous scaling
        that was applied internally to convert ice effective radius to generalized
        effective size for the Fu parameterization has been removed.  Any necessary
        scaling needed to provide the proper ice particle size must be done before
        input to the radiation in the GCM version of the code.  This is consistent 
        with the input requirement for the column version of the model.  Note that
        the internal ice optics parameterizations are effective over specific ranges
        of particle size.  Results may be different from previous versions if the
        Fu parameterization is used in the GCM version of the code.  Also fixed 
        the definition of the secant of the diffusivity angle, which varies as a
        function of the water column amount.  This change only affects results in 
        profiles with more than eight precipitable cm of water vapor.  

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in September 2008.


August 29, 2008:

        Release_4_7

        Revised cloud property input to require in-cloud averaged cloud optical
        depth or in-cloud averaged cloud ice and liquid water paths in both the
        single-column and gcm versions of the code. In earlier versions of the gcm
        code, input grid-averaged cloud properties were scaled by the cloud fraction
        internally to generate in-cloud averaged properties.  This change requires 
        that this scaling be performed during the interfacing if necessary.  The
        minor structural modifications to the code have no effect on the results,
        though a minor change to the factor used to convert flux to heating rate
        will have a negligible effect on the heating rates. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2008.

        - Added requirement that cloud properties be input as in-cloud averages
          rather than grid-averaged values in GCM code.
        - Renamed rrtmg_lw.f90 to rrtmg_lw_rad.f90 and renamed rrtmg_lw.nomcica.f90
          to rrtmg_lw_rad.nomcica.f90 for consistency between file names and
          module names. 
        - Replaced several 'where' statements with traditional loops in module
          mcica_subcol_gen_lw to improve computational performance on some systems.
        - Moved subroutine lwcldpr, which contains cloud absorption coefficient
          data, from module rrtmg_lw_cldprop.f90 to rrtmg_lw_init.f90.
        - Removed unnecessary use association of module mcica_subcol_gen_lw
          from rrtmg_lw_rad.nomcica.f90. 
        - Corrected arrays wavenum1 and wavenum2 in rrtmg_lw_init.f90 to change 
          the boundary between spectral band 14 and 15 from 2390 to 2380 cm-1. 
          These arrays are not used in the calculation, and the functional array
          delwave containing the band intervals was correct, so this change has
          no effect on results.
        - Revised definition and naming of integer and real kind type parameters. 
        - Changed setting of flag for selecting random number generator (irng) for
          McICA to make it a required input variable. Available options are kissvec 
          or Mersenne Twister. 
        - Increased precision of heatfac by changing it from a hard-wired value to 
          a calculated value and changed code to require input of specific heat of 
          dry air into init module (rrtmg_lw_init.f90) for heatfac calculation.   
        - Oxygen volume mixing ratio was changed from a hard-wired parameter to
          a required input array. 


April 24, 2008:

        Release_4_5

        Added capability to treat longwave aerosol absorption and added use of 
        input file IN_AER_RRTM to read in aerosol optical depths following the
        application of this file in RRTMG_SW.  Aerosol scattering is not presently 
        available in the longwave, so the required input is limited to the aerosol 
        optical depth by layer at the mid-point of each of the 16 spectral bands. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in April 2008.


September 7, 2007:

        Release_4_4

        Modified use of ice particle size variables rei/reicmc to utilize separate 
        variable names (dge/dgesmc) when units of generalized effective size are 
        required for iceflag=3 option. This allowed use of ice particle size in
        units of effective radius to parameterize cloud absorptivity using a basic
        approach when ice particle sizes are larger than the permitted range for
        the iceflag=3 option. Results may be minimally affected when ice particle
        sizes exceed 90 microns and iceflag=3 option is used. Also modified several
        local arrays in top-level subroutine module to accomodate an extra model 
        layer if this feature is utilized. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in September 2007.


August 28, 2007:

        Release_4_3

        Minor changes to makefile for AIX.  Corrected use of variables icld
        and nlay in top level source files for the subroutine version of code and
        for the McICA sub-column generator. There was no impact on results from
        these changes in the column version of the model. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2007.


August 22, 2007:

        Release_4_1

        Made structural changes to modify code to use assumed-shape arrays
        rather than explicit-shape arrays throughout the model.  There was 
        no impact on results from these changes. 

        Publicly released on AER RT web site in August 2007.

        - Converted explicit-shape arrays to assumed-shape arrays.
        - Modified top level subroutine to a module and converted most of the
          other subroutines to modules.
        - Modified makefiles to clean up handling of compiled modules.
        - Added new makefile for AIX platforms.
        - Changed the name of the exponential lookup table arrays for 
          consistency with RRTMG_SW.
        - Added build directory for makefiles and doc directory for
          documentation to main model directory for consistency with other
          AER RT model archives.


April 27, 2007:

        Release_4_02

        Made kind type suffix changes.

        Not publicly released. Released to Yu-Tau Hou/NCEP on 30 April 2007.


        - Added several missing kind type suffixes to real constants in a few 
          source modules.
        - Made minor changes to README file.  


April 26, 2007:

        Release_4_01

        Minor bug fix and other minor changes.

        Not publicly released. 

        - Fixed dimensions of arrays abscoice and abscoliq from nbands to ngpt
          in source module rrtmg_lw_cldprmc.f90.  This did not affect results in
          most situations, but caused a fault in some cases on some compilers. 


April 17, 2007:

        Release_4_0

        Major source code format revisions and addition of McICA capability. 

        Not publicly released. Released to Robert Pincus/NOAA on 18 April 2007.

        - Reformatted entire model to utilize more FORTRAN90 coding features.
          All COMMON blocks have been removed.  Arrays are declared and dimensioned
          in modules, and array passing is done through subroutine calls.
          Excluded from the reformatting are files rrtatm.f, extra.f, and util_*.f,
          which are shared with and retain the formatting of RRTM_LW. 
        - Code package can be used as a stand-alone column model or as a callable
          subroutine (such as in a GCM).
        - McICA capability has been added for stochastic representation of sub-grid
          cloud variability such as cloud fraction and cloud overlap.
        - Sub-column generator for McICA is called from within main source module
          in column mode, but it must be called prior to RRTMG_LW in GCM mode.
        - Installed two options for the random number generator required for
          McICA (selected by changing the hard-wired flag irnd).
        - Modified code to accept either cloud physical properties or cloud optical
          properties when using McICA. 
        - Created makefiles consistent with RRTMG_SW for SGI, SUN, LINUX (pgi) and
          OS_X (g95) platforms.
       

August 26, 2005:

        Release_3_21

        Added several minor code changes that do not affect results.

        Not publicly released.
        This version was utilized to test McICA in RRTMG_LW.

        - Converted several trace gases from scalars to arrays in rrtmg_lw_140.f
        - Corrected use of index IBND in rrtmg_lw_rtrn.f and rrtmg_lw_rtrnmr.f

July 28, 2005:

        Release_3_2

        Updating code to maintain consistency with RRTM_LW.
        Not publicly released.

        - Added WV continuum coefficients inadvertantly left out of k_gB15.f in the original
          RRTM_LW_v3.0 release
        - Updated rrtatm.f to be compatible with CVS revision 9.3 lblrtm.f
        - Fixed bug in the digits of PI in rrtmg_lw.f
        - Modified cldprop for updated ice properties
                * Updated the cldprop spheres to use latest streamer version 3.0.
                * Remade Fu properties on finer grid.
        - Added patent statement to all modules
        - Changed number of digits printed out in net flux in rrtmg_lw.f
        - Updated revision number format to be consistent with RRTM_SW/LBLRTM

April 22, 2004:
	
	Release_3_01 

        Not publicly released.

        - Source file names were changed for consistency to use the prefix rrtmg_lw. 
          The README file and makefile were also updated.

October 16, 2003:

	Release_3_0 

	RRTMG_LW is now being officially archived in CVS.  This code evolved from the standard 
        RRTM_LW release.  It includes modifications to enhance performance such as a reduced 
        g-point	set, and it is intended for application to GCMs.  Both a column version and a 
        subroutine version of this code are archived.

        This version was distributed to Kerry Emanuel (MIT) for use in the MIT radiative-convective 
        single column model.
        
        - Initial release version.  This version includes modifications to implement a spectrally 
               varying diffusivity angle based on the column precipitable water amount.
