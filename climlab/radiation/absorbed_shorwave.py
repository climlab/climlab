class SimpleAbsorbedShortwave(EnergyBudget):
    '''A class for the shortwave radiation process in a one-layer EBM.
    The basic assumption is that all the shortwave absorption occurs at the surface.

    Computes the diagnostic ``ASR`` (absorbed shortwave radiation)
    from the formula ``self.ASR = (1-self.albedo) * self.insolation``
    and applies this as a tendency on the surface temperature ``self.Ts``

    ``albedo`` and ``insolation`` are given as inputs.
    These should either be scalars
    or have same dimensions as state variable ``Ts``

    User can supply constants, or link to diagnostics of specific insolation
    and albedo processes.
