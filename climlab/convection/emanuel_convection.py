    '''
    The climlab wrapper for Kerry Emanuel's moist convection scheme <https://emanuel.mit.edu/FORTRAN-subroutine-convect>

    From the documentation distributed with the Fortran 77 code CONVECT:

        The subroutine is designed to be used in time-marching models of mesoscale to global-scale dimensions.
        It is meant to represent the effects of all moist convection, including shallow, non-precipitating cumulus.
        It also contains a dry adiabatic adjustment scheme.

        Since the method of calculating the convective fluxes involves a relaxation toward quasi-equilibrium,
        subroutine CONVECT must be run for at least several time steps to give meaningful results.
        At the first time step, the tendencies and convective precipitation will be zero.
        If the initial sounding is unstable, these will rapidly increase over successive time steps,
        depending on the values of the constants ALPHA and DAMP.
        Thus the user interested in convective fluxes and precipitation
        associated with a single initial sounding (i.e., without large-scale forcing)
        should still march CONVECT forward enough time steps that the fluxes have
        returned back to zero;
        the net tendencies and precipitation integrated over this time interval are then the desired results.
        But it should be cautioned that these quantities will not necessarily be
        independent of other model parameters such as the time step.
        CONVECT is very much built on the philosophy that convection,
        to the extent it can be represented in terms of large-scale variables,
        is never very far away from statistical equilibrium with the large-scale flow.
        To achieve a smooth evolution of the convective forcing,
        CONVECT should be called at least every 20 minutes during the time integration.
        CONVECT will work at longer time intervals, but the convective tendencies may become noisy.

    Basic characteristics:

    State:

        - Ts (surface radiative temperature -- optional, and ignored)
        - Tatm (air temperature in K)
        - q (specific humidity in kg/kg)
        - U (zonal velocity in m/s -- optional)
        - V (meridional velocity in m/s -- optional)

    Input arguments and default values (taken from convect43.f fortran source):

        - MINORIG = 0,  index of lowest level from which convection may originate (zero means lowest)
        - ELCRIT = 0.0011,  autoconversion threshold water content (g/g)
        - TLCRIT = -55.0, critical temperature below which the auto-conversion threshold is assumed to be zero (the autoconversion threshold varies linearly between 0 C and TLCRIT)
        - ENTP = 1.5, coefficient of mixing in the entrainment formulation
        - SIGD = 0.05, fractional area covered by unsaturated downdraft
        - SIGS = 0.12, fraction of precipitation falling outside of cloud
        - OMTRAIN = 50.0, assumed fall speed (Pa/s) of rain
        - OMTSNOW = 5.5, assumed fall speed (Pa/s) of snow
        - COEFFR = 1.0, coefficient governing the rate of evaporation of rain
        - COEFFS = 0.8, coefficient governing the rate of evaporation of snow
        - CU = 0.7, coefficient governing convective momentum transport
        - BETA = 10.0, coefficient used in downdraft velocity scale calculation
        - DTMAX = 0.9, maximum negative temperature perturbation a lifted parcel is allowed to have below its LFC
        - ALPHA = 0.2, first parameter that controls the rate of approach to quasi-equilibrium
        - DAMP = 0.1, second parameter that controls the rate of approach to quasi-equilibrium (DAMP must be less than 1)
        - IPBL = 0, switch to bypass the dry convective adjustment (bypass if IPBL==0)

    Tendencies computed:

        - air temperature (K/s)
        - specific humidity (kg/kg/s)
        - optional:
            - U and V wind components (m/s/s), if U and V are included in state dictionary

    Diagnostics computed:

        - CBMF (cloud base mass flux in kg/m2/s) -- this is actually stored internally and used as input for subsequent timesteps
        - precipitation (convective precipitation rate in kg/m2/s or mm/s)
        - relative_humidity (dimensionless)

        :Example:

            Here is an example of setting up a single-column
            Radiative-Convective model with interactive water vapor.

            This example also demonstrates *asynchronous coupling*:
            the radiation uses a longer timestep than the other model components::
