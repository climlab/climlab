Below is a collection of notebooks illustrating some typical climlab use cases.
These documents are built from Jupyter notebooks,
mostly based on class material developed by Brian Rose at the University at Albany.

For a more comprehensive set of climlab usage examples embedded within lecture notes on climate science,
see Brian's online textbook `The Climate Laboratory <https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/>`_.

If you want to run the code yourself, these notes are all available as Jupyter *.ipynb files
in the ``docs/source/courseware`` directory of the `climlab source <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab>`_.
