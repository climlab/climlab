Tutorials
=========

Here is a collection of notebooks giving example usage of the ``climlab`` package.
These notebooks are based on classroom material developed by Brian Rose
at the University at Albany.

You can read and browse the notes below.

If you want to run the code yourself, these notes are all available as Jupyter *.ipynb files
in the ``courseware`` directory of the climlab source.
